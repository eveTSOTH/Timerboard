## Welcome to the TSOTH Timerboard Page

The Sound Of Thunder believes in self-reliance and independence from the blue donut of EVE. We refuse to use other alliances software like Auth and SEAT as that would make us reliant on them. So we have committed to building things "in-house", such as this new timer board. It is basic, but it serves our needs.
